##### 내 풀이

```python

# 1. on CheckiO your solution should be a function
# 2. the function should return the right answer, not print it.

def say_hi(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    """
        Hi!
    """
    # your code here
    return ("Hi. My name is " + str(name) +" and I'm " + str(age) + " years old")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
    assert say_hi("Alex", 32) == "Hi. My name is Alex and I'm 32 years old", "First"
    assert say_hi("Frank", 68) == "Hi. My name is Frank and I'm 68 years old", "Second"
    print('Done. Time to Check.')

```
